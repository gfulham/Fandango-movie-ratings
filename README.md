# Does Fandango Still Inflate Their Movie Ratings
In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest. He published his analysis in [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/).
Hickey found that there's a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed for movie ratings and the actual rating, 


**The goal** of this project is to analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis in 2015.

- Walt Hickey made the data he analyzed publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data).
- The dataset we are working with comes from [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/whose-reviews-should-you-trust-imdb-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-or-fandango-7d1010c6cf19/).
